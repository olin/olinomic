## Case 0: Cieminski v Kincaid
### 2018-10-25/26

**Questions:**
- Was the Duel [between Mitch Cieminski and Claire Kincaid] indeed able to complete?

**Rulings:**
- Judgement: The Duel between Mitch Cieminski and Claire Kincaid was unable to complete.
- Opinion: The Duel between Mitch Cieminski and Claire Kincaid is illegal and should be Cancelled.

**Reasonings:**
> …the term Duel is used throughout the rule \[It's time to D-D-D-D-DUEL!\] to describe the entirety of the action, from Challenge to point transfer. …if the Duel ended, it certainly ended at the same time that RC 328 passed. However, as per Rule 205, "When A Rule Becomes A Law,"
> 
> > An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.
> 
> This plainly means that at the moment that the Duel possibly ended, the adopted rule-change was in effect. This means that the Duel was, at the time it might have been completed, illegal, according to Rule 328:
> 
> > The magnitude of the number of points over which to Duel must not exceed the magnitude of either the Challenger's or the Challenged's current scores.
