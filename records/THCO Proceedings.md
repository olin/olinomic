# The High Court Of Olinomic Proceedings
This document contains a record of every Session of The High Court since 2018-10-25.

## Case 0: Cieminski v Kincaid
### 2018-10-25/26

**Questions:**
- Was the Duel [between Mitch Cieminski and Claire Kincaid] indeed able to complete?

**Rulings:**
- Judgement: The Duel between Mitch Cieminski and Claire Kincaid was unable to complete.
- Opinion: The Duel between Mitch Cieminski and Claire Kincaid is illegal and should be Cancelled.

**Reasonings:**
> …the term Duel is used throughout the rule \[It's time to D-D-D-D-DUEL!\] to describe the entirety of the action, from Challenge to point transfer. …if the Duel ended, it certainly ended at the same time that RC 328 passed. However, as per Rule 205, "When A Rule Becomes A Law,"
> 
> > An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.
> 
> This plainly means that at the moment that the Duel possibly ended, the adopted rule-change was in effect. This means that the Duel was, at the time it might have been completed, illegal, according to Rule 328:
> 
> > The magnitude of the number of points over which to Duel must not exceed the magnitude of either the Challenger's or the Challenged's current scores.

## Case 1: "I don't care"
### 2018-11-09/10

**Questions:**
- Can a vote for "I don't care" be counted as "in favor"?

**Rulings:**
- Judgement: yes.

**Reasonings:**
> Olinomic has a long historical precedent of counting votes like "for" and "yes" as "in favor" for the purposes of determining the outcome of an adoption mechanism, and votes like "no" and "disapprove" as "against" for [Rule 204](https://github.com/olin/olinomic/blob/master/rules.md#204). Which isn't to say that this tradition is legal per se, but that it at least has never been found to be illegal. More importantly, the allowance of this has historically seemed to rely on the fact that the Gamemaster "counts votes on each rule-change and collects ballots in a manner of their choosing" ([Rule 215](https://github.com/olin/olinomic/blob/master/rules.md#215)), which has been interpreted to mean that the Gamemaster also is to interpret ballots when they are in some way unclear. "I don't care" seems to be a vote that's quite unclear in its intentions, and therefore interpreting it falls to the Gamemaster. So indeed such a vote can count as "in favor" or "against", and the difference between "can count" and "does count" falls within the prerogative of the Gamemaster.

> Furthermore, this hypothetical duty of the Gamemaster has a check, giving us reason to believe that it's an appropriate power for them to have. As per Rule 215, "Actions of the Gamemaster can be overturned by Judgement or unanimous vote of all other players", meaning that if the Gamemaster's interpretation is clearly out of line, Players have recourse for forcing a "correct" interpretation. This check is sufficient to allow the Gamemaster such interpretive power.

## Case 2: On the Identity of The Bear
### 2019-02-10

**Questions:**
- Who is The Bear?

**Rulings:**
- Claire Kincaid \<<sean.foley@olin.edu>\> is The Bear.

**Reasonings:**
> It was ruled during an earlier challenge to this clause that the entity referred to as “Claire Kincaid” in the rules should be interpreted as Clur Klinclurd, also known as Claire Kincaid, regardless of player names. However, recall that the High Court is not bound by its past decisions. I would posit with the public ulterior motive of not bothering the non-player Claire Kincaid that the rule should, in fact, refer to the player Claire Kincaid.

## Case 3: Kincaid v Foley
### 2019-03-08/09

**Questions:**
- Can a player using the same email address vote twice in the same turn, if they forfeit between votes?
- Specifically, did the player(s) using the email address 2015sfoley@gmail.com vote twice during this turn?

**Rulings:**
- A player may always vote twice, whether they forfeit in between or not, but they still only get one vote, which means that they move their original vote from one place to another when they re-vote.
- The player(s) using the email address 2015sfoley@gmail.com is one player, who voted twice during this turn, yet only the latter of those votes ought to be counted by the Gamemaster.

**Seasonings:**
> Given that Rule 215 states that the Gamemaster "Keeps a record of all current players and their scores and strikes players from the record when they lose their player status," I believe it is within the Gamemaster's prerogative to what use whatever tools they deem necessary to determine playerhood.

> Rule 101 clearly states that "A player shall be considered any member of the olinomic mailing list that announces their intent to play to the Gamemaster. People who have lost player status according to the rules may rejoin the game in this manner." There are a few key nouns in this sentence that help us determine what a 'player' is. 
> A _player_ is a _member of the list_; 
> A _person_ who was a _player_ can rejoin.

> This indicates that a player must be a member of the list before they can declare their intent to play. It also means that when a player loses their player status, they become a person who can rejoin the game, presumably re-gaining their player status.

> This means that if a member of the list loses their player status and re-joins the game, they are the same player. And, as Rule 207 reminds us, "each player always has exactly one vote." Yet as determined previously, players are allowed to divide their votes and move them from one place to another.
