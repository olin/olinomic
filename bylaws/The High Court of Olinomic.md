## I. Chief Justice of Olinomic
Justin Kunimune is currently the Chief Justice of Olinomic.

## II. Judgement
The Court delivers Judgement by unanimous agreement of its Justices.

## III. Opinion
The Court delivers its opinion by unanimous agreement of its Justices. The Court's opinion, while bound by the limits set forth in the Rules, is not a question of Judgement of what the rules themselves would prefer (though Justices' votes can of course be a reflection of what they believe the rules would prefer), and only carries weight when the Rules explicitly say it does.

## III. Amendments
These By-Laws may be changed with the majority consent of all current Justices.
