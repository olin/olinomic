## I. Chief Justice of Olinomic
Justin Kunimune is currently the Chief Justice of Olinomic.

## II. Proceedings
Judgements and Opinions are Rulings. Only when the court is in Session can it deliver Rulings. The Court can be called to Session by any of its Justices by a declaration to the mailing list containing the string "BANG! The High Court of Olinomic is now in Session.". Said declaration must include a question posed to The Court, and a case number, which must be a real number never before assigned to a Court Session.

While The Court is in Session, it is the Chief Justiceâ€™s responsibility to regulate discussion.

After a Session has yielded at least one Ruling, the Chief Justice can Adjourn The Court by a declaration to the mailing list containing the string "By the power invested in me by The Gavel Of Justices, The High Court of Olinomic is hereby Adjourned. BANG!", thus ending the Session. The Session date(s), case number, original question, and any Rulings shall be recorded in a document publicly available to all Olinomic players.

## III. Judgement
The Court delivers Judgement by unanimous agreement of its Justices.

## IV. Opinion
The Court delivers its opinion by unanimous agreement of its Justices. The Court's opinion, while bound by the limits set forth in the Rules, is not a question of Judgement of what the rules themselves would prefer (though Justices' votes can of course be a reflection of what they believe the rules would prefer), and only carries weight when the Rules explicitly say it does.

## V. Amendments
These By-Laws may be changed with the majority consent of all current Justices.
