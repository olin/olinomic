#Olinomic Official Rules

(Initial Set of Rules modified by Mitchell Cieminski from http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm)

##101 (Immutable). 
Olinomic is a game of nomic, wherin persons, acting in accordance with the rules, communicate their game actions and results of these actions on the olinomic mailing list. All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The game may be won, but the game never ends.

A player shall be considered any member of the olinomic mailing list that announces their intent to play to the Gamemaster. People who have lost player status according to the rules may rejoin the game in this manner.

##102 (Immutable). 
Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

##103 (Immutable). 
A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

##104 (Immutable). 
All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

##105 (Immutable). 
Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule-changes.

##106 (Immutable). 
All proposed rule-changes shall be sent to the olinomic mailing list before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.

##107 (Immutable). 
No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.

##108 (Immutable). 
Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives the number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment. 

All rules which change numbers automatically have "This Rule was previously known as Rule " and the previous rule number appended to them.

##109 (Immutable). 
Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

##110 (Immutable). 
In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable rule.

##111 (Immutable). 
If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and vote before the end of the turn.

##112 (Immutable). 
The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving n points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

##113 (Immutable). 
A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed. If a player forfeits, they lose their player status.

##114 (Immutable). 
There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.

##115 (Immutable). 
Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

##116 (Immutable). 
Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

##201 (Mutable). 
Players shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname, taking one whole turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.

##202 (Mutable). 
One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) subtracting 291 from the ordinal number of the proposal, multiplying the result by the fraction of favorable votes it receives, rounding the result to the nearest integer, and adding this number to one's score (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.).

##203 (Mutable).
A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. If this rule is not amended by the end of the second complete circuit of turns, it automatically changes to require only a simple majority.

##204 (Mutable). 
If and when rule-changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points each.

##205 (Mutable). 
An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.

##206 (Mutable). 
When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.

##207 (Mutable). 
Each player always has exactly one vote.

##208 (Mutable). 
The winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points. If a player wins in this manner, all points are reset to 0.

##209 (Mutable). 
At no time may there be more than 30 mutable rules.

##210 (Mutable). 
Players may not conspire or consult on the making of future rule-changes unless they are teammates. 

##211 (Mutable). 
If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

##212 (Mutable). 
If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.

When Judgment has been invoked, the turn does not end without the consent of a majority of the other players or until Judgement has been decided.

The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, or if the Judge decides to defer Judgement, then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.

Unless a Judge is overruled or defers Judgement, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

##213 (Mutable). 
If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner. After winning in this way, that player (and any other people that the winner recruits) must decide how to fix the loophole and change the rules by fiat so that gameplay can continue. If they refuse this duty, the duty falls to the Gamemaster.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner. 

##214 (Mutable). 
Each turn will end at 3:30 PM, Olin Time. A turn's end will occur (initially) two days after a turn begins. If a turn is extended according to another rule, it will be extended in whole-day incriments. If any player has not cast a vote on a rule-change by the time one hour before the turn ends, then their player status is removed, the vote is counted as if they were not eligible voters, and the turn continues. Immediately after a turn ends, the next turn begins. If a vote on a rule-change has not been called by its proponent by 1:00 PM the day that the turn ends, the rule-change automatically fails and the proponent loses player status.

##215 (Mutable). 
There is a Gamemaster. The Gamemaster's solemn duty is to make sure the game runs smoothly. The Gamemaster 

1. keeps a record of all current players and their scores and strikes players from the record when they lose their player status
2. counts votes on each rule-change and collects ballots in a manner of their choosing
3. keeps an up-to-date rules list online 
4. informs players that they have violated a rule and of any penalties associated with that violation
5. declares new turns to all players in a timely manner, including whose turn it currently is

The Gamemaster may 

1. extend a turn for any reason
2. deputise another player to act as Gamemaster for some number of turns (The Gamemaster wins all disagreements between them and their deputy)
3. vote on any matter, and cast the tie-breaking vote on any matter (doing so does not violate the one-vote rule)
4. pause the game indefinitely or resume it from a pause

The Gamemaster cannot lose their player status. Actions of the Gamemaster can be overturned by Judgement or unanimous vote of all other players.

In the event that a Gamemaster is unreachable but needs to do something for the game to proceed, the turn is extended by one day and the current Judge becomes deputy Gamemaster for that day, as described above.

The Gamemaster is currently Mitchell Cieminski. If the Gamemaster resigns from office, they can amend this rule only to appoint a new Gamemaster. Otherwise, new Gamemasters are determined by amending this rule in the usual way.

##301 (Mutable).
All rules must have a Title to be enacted. The Title of a rule is a part of that rule.

A committee will be formed to determine identifiers in place of Titles for all rules that exist at the time of this rule's enactment (that is, rules with ordinal numbers lower than 301 at the time of enactment). These special identifiers are known as Historical Names and will appear in quotes identifying them as such (to avoid confusion, no Titles may be entirely enclosed in quotation marks). A rule's Historical Name is not considered a part of that rule and therefore does not bind a player's actions, but may still be used by Judges to decide Judgement.

Once a Historical Name has been established, it can become a Title, and therefore a part of the rule, by means of amendment. A rule with a Historical Name can also be honored by keeping its Historical Name indefinitely, even if the rule is amended. Therefore, only rules that once had ordinal numbers lower than 301 can have Historical Names. A rule's Historical Name cannot be changed to a different Historical Name, but can be changed to a Title of the same or different wording by means of amendment.
